<p id="accessabmain" style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong><span>Explore anarchism</span></strong></p>
<p id="accessab">So, boy, girl, or my non-binary friend, if you are just starting your anarchist study, this page is for you. Here I have listed everything that, in my opinion, is worth your attention. The list is sometimes updated. The books are listed in all the languages that I could find.</p>
<p id="accessab">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="accessabmaina" style="font-size: 18pt;"><span><strong>Literature:</strong><br></span></p>

<p id="accessab"><br><strong>"Between Peasants"</strong> <em>(Malatesta Errico)</em>&nbsp;is the shortest introduction to anarchism (just a bit longer than this one!). An interesting presentation in the form of a dialogue between two peasants. Read in one evening. (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-between-peasants">eng</a>, <a href="https://ru.theanarchistlibrary.org/library/erriko-malatesta-krestyanskie-rechi">rus</a>)</p>
<p id="accessab"><strong>"At The Caf√©" (or "A Brief System of Anarchism in Ten Conversations")</strong> <em>(Malatesta Errico)</em> is a pamphlet book that can be read in two evenings! Runs through all the basic ideas of anarcho-communism, but in more detail than the one above. (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-at-the-cafe">eng</a>, <a href="https://ru.theanarchistlibrary.org/library/erriko-malatesta-kratkaya-sistema-anarhizma-v-desyati-besedah">rus</a>)</p>
<p id="accessab"><strong>"Anarchy Works"</strong> <em>(Peter Gelderloos)</em> is a pretty big book that reveals anarchism in the form of questions and answers. "Aren't people inherently selfish?" "Isn't domination and power natural?" "How will decisions be made?" "Who wants to work without pay?" "But people need bosses and experts?" -- that's exactly what Peter answers (and hundreds of other questions). In fact, this is probably the best anarchy book I've ever read. (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works">eng</a>, <a href="https://ru.theanarchistlibrary.org/library/piter-gelderloos-anarhiya-rabotaet">rus</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p id="accessab"><strong>"Bolo'Bolo"</strong>&nbsp;<em>(P.M.)</em> is a nice medium size book about the "cultural revolution": what does a truly <em>socially free</em> world look like? The author tells how to achieve anarchism in just five years, "if we all start now". (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/p-m-bolo-bolo">eng</a>, <a href="https://ru.theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bolo-bolo">rus</a>)</p><p id="accessab"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">www.Masculism.wiki</span>&nbsp;talks about the very important struggle against men's discrimination, but without transphobia, misogyny or right-wing bullshit. Read in 5-7 minutes! (<a href="https://masculism.wiki/" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">eng</a>, <a href="https://masculism.wiki/fi" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">fin</a>)<br><br><strong>The Anarchist Library</strong> is not a book. This is a site that has a huge number of various articles, as well as every book that was mentioned here. Check it out!</p>

<p id="accessabmainb" style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span>Movies:</span></strong></p>
<p id="accessab">(A) - really reveals anarchist ideas<br>(B) - about anarchism, but it's not the main theme<br>(C) - somewhat anarchist<br><br><br></p>
<p id="accessab"><strong>(A) "Land and Freedom"</strong> (1995). A wonderful, touching film about the Spanish Revolution. The film shows the brave struggle of the people for the great idea. In addition to the beautiful picture, many of the real features of anarchism are also expressed here: people now and then discuss and vote instead of deciding one for all; the senior in rank "convinces" the soldier of the cost of something, instead of a rude order to "do so", and so on. But the quality of the movie on the Internet is shit...<br><br> <br>


<strong><br>(B) "Anarchists"</strong> (2005). Quite an interesting art-house film about French anarchists (remarkably, those who lived after the Paris Commune). The protagonist is a policeman implanted in a gang of anarchists for the sake of surveillance. It does not so much reveal the ideas of anarchism as it tells specifically about the relationship between the characters. I would advise watching it to those who have already figured out the theory.<br><br><strong>(B) "Anarchist from Colony"</strong> (2017). Pretty interesting biographical film about anarchist Park Yeol. Talking more actually about Park's life's history than about anarchism, but good enough!<br><br><strong>(B) "Free State of Jones"</strong> (2016). Great film! Main idea is not about anarchism, but about abolitionism (slavery canceling in USA). Though it still shows socialist and pro-anarchist ideas "used on practice": blacks are tired of being slaves, whites are tired of dying on (American Civil) war to protect rich slave holders - so "how about we unite and make a free state, where is no government, racial division or wage labor?". Really recommend this one! <br>

<br>

<p id="accessab"><strong><br>(C) "Ted K."</strong> (2021). Not about anarchism at all, but if you're interested in Unabomber's biography, I can recommend this film.&nbsp; <br><br>
<strong>(C) "Matewan"</strong> (1987). It doesn't have anarchist ideas directly, but it does show the opposition of one of the first unions to greedy mine owners. It's funny how the Marxist protagonist regularly calls for obedience to somewhat of a "revolutionary party", when people ask what business the party has with their small town and whether they'd be better off figuring things out for themselves (thus expressing the natural spirit of anarchism). <br><br>
<strong>(C) "Punishment Park"</strong> (1971). Once again: not directly about anarchism, but on the other side, deep critics of the government. Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary about dystopic version of the 1970s, where under title 2 of the Internal Security Act President Nixon has consolidated all domestic governmental authority within the executive branch and instructed the police and military to detain and punish any and all dissent. Dissident trials are foregone conclusions, and afterwards they are given the choice of long prison terms or the opportunity of gaining freedom by surviving the guantlet of running fifty-six miles through the desert while being hunted by police and national guard troops. The movie has never been shown on American TV. <br>

<p id="accessabe" style="font-size: 18pt;"><span>And those I <strong>do not</strong> recommend:</span></p>
<p id="accessab">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="accessab"><strong>"What to do in case of fire?"</strong> is a film about some rebel boys who blow up buildings for fun and then get themselves in trouble, lol. There is very little about anarchism. I do not recommend it.</p>
<p id="accessab"><strong>"The Anarchist Cookbook"</strong> overall is literally anti-anarchist. Also it shows male rape as comedy element. Yack. Not recommended at all.</p>
<p id="accessab">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="accessab">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="accessabmainc" style="font-size: 18pt;"><span><strong>Movements:</strong></span></p>
<p id="accessab">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="accessab">It is worth joining movements, first of all, local ones. If you live in Spain, study Spanish anarchist movements; there at least one of them in almost every city. You can find about anarchism also a lot in social media, ex. Instagram. You can try to visit any protest, activist camp, concert, <strong>squat</strong> - it is very easy to find friends and new contacts there!</p>
